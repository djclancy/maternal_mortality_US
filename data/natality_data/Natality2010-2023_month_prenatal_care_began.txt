"2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."

"4. Beginning in 2014, month prenatal care began is calculated using gestational age based on the obstetric estimate. For years"
"2013 and earlier, month prenatal care began was based on gestational age calculated using the date of the last normal menses."
"This change may lead to a slight discontinuity in prenatal care results between years 2013 and 2014."
